Usage
-----

To use a shell script for provisioning you have to tell Vagrant about it in your Vagrantfile:

    config.vm.provision "shell", path: "provision.sh"

You're advised to submodule this repository into your own:

    $ git submodule add https://github.com/boof/vagrant.sh.git .sh

To load the modules just source the generic module into your provisioning script (provision.sh) and use the provision function:

    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    source /vagrant/.sh/base.sh
    set-timezone 'Europe/Berlin'
    provision modulename ...

TODOs
